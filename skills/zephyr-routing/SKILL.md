name: zephyr-routing
description: Route Zephyr entries from any document to their proper bake logs, with deduplication, reverse chronological ordering, and move or copy semantics. Use when asked to route Zephyr entries, move entries out of a log to where they belong, or clean up a document holding mixed entries.
---

## Overview

Routing takes a document containing mixed content and delivers each Zephyr entry to its proper bake log.

This skill is deliberately self-contained so it can be replaced with a different routing implementation without touching the [[zephyr]] skill.

Filename resolution, weight notation, event_time tags, and parameter precedence are owned by the [[zephyr]] skill — routing consumes those rules, it does not restate them.

Read the [[zephyr]] skill before routing, for the bake log naming convention and the parameter defaults.

## Parameters

- mode — `move` or `copy`; default `move`
- bake log directory — resolved per the Parameters section of the [[zephyr]] skill

## Trigger

Route only when explicitly asked.

Never route automatically just because a bake log or other document is open.

A request may grant a session-level standing instruction, for example "keep routing entries as we go" — honor it for that session only.

Requests that trigger routing:

- "Route the Zephyr entries in this log"
- "Route Zephyr entries from bake log 6-10 to their proper logs"
- "Move the Zephyr 9 entries out of this file"
- "Clean up the mixed entries in this log"

Requests that do NOT trigger routing (even if they involve Zephyr entries):

- "Update the event times in this log" — that is the [[zephyr]] skill
- "Add event_time tags to the Zephyr entries" — that is the [[zephyr]] skill
- "Apply Grafana annotations" — that is the [[grafana-bake-annotation]] skill
- "Update the Grafana links" — that is the [[zephyr-grafana-links]] skill
- Opening or reading a bake log for any other purpose

## Identify

An entry is a timestamp heading plus the body below it, up to the next heading.

Source documents deliver entries at H2, while entries already filed inside a bake log's `## bake log` section sit at H3.

A Zephyr entry is one whose body contains a key of the form "For Zephyr N" or "For Zephyr N-M".

Entries without a Zephyr key are never touched, moved, or modified.

## Resolve

Resolve each key against the entry's header date, not today's date.

Choose the most recent date with that day number on or before the header date.

Example: "Zephyr 31" under a June 1 header resolves to May 31, not June 31.

Resolve the key to a filename through the Bake Log Naming Convention in the [[zephyr]] skill.

## Create Missing Targets

If the resolved bake log does not exist, create it.

Scaffold minimally: a `## bake log` section holding the routed entries at H3, nothing more.

Do not generate a recipe layout — recipe scaffolding is its own deliberate step.

## Insert

Routed entries go under the `## bake log` section of the target, demoted from H2 to H3 so they nest inside that section rather than sitting beside it.

Demote any sub-heading inside an entry body by one level to match, so it stays a child of its entry.

Keep all Zephyr entries in that section in reverse chronological order — newest first.

Sort by the event time stated in the body; fall back to the header timestamp when the body states no time.

## Deduplication

Normalize the entry first (weight notation per the [[zephyr]] skill), then compare.

Skip an entry when the target already contains one with the same header timestamp, the same Zephyr key, and the same normalized body.

## Override Semantics

A later memo supersedes an earlier one only when it reads as a restatement or correction of the same fact.

When it does, keep the later entry and drop the earlier one.

Two entries at or near the same timestamp that record different facts both stay — same-minute timing alone never implies override.

When unsure whether one supersedes the other, keep both and report the pair to the user.

## Mode: Move or Copy

In move mode (the default), remove each routed entry from the source document after it lands in the target.

In copy mode, leave the source document untouched.

## Delete Empty Source

Emptiness deletes the source document, not routing.

Routing is one of the things that can empty it, and it is not the only one.

The check runs once, at the very end of the request, after every step that draws entries out of the source — including steps this skill does not own.

A request commonly pairs routing with a follow-on step, such as moving the entries that did not route into some other document.

Those entries left the source too, so the check waits for that step to finish before it looks.

A document is empty when it holds no headings and no body content — only whitespace or a trailing newline.

Delete the source file when both of these are true:

- Mode is move, not copy
- The document is empty at the end of the request

Which step emptied it does not matter, and neither does whether this skill routed anything at all.

A source that routed nothing and was drained entirely by a follow-on step is deleted.

A source that was already empty when the request began is deleted.

Keep the file whenever any content remains.

A single heading, a line of body text, or frontmatter is enough to keep it, even when every Zephyr entry routed out.

## Normalize on Write

Apply weight notation rules as entries land in the target.

Add event_time tags to entries that record discrete bake actions, per the [[zephyr]] skill.

## Commit

Commit each modified bake log, one commit per file.

For the source document:

- If it was modified but not deleted, commit it as a separate commit.
- If it was deleted (empty source, move mode), commit the deletion as a separate commit.
- If it was untouched (copy mode), skip it.
