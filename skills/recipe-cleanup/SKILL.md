## Recipe Cleanup

Parse the input: the first argument is either a local recipe file path or a URL to a recipe page. The optional second argument is the source URL for the original recipe. Any remaining text after the URL or file path is treated as inline recipe content (ingredients, instructions, notes).

Determine the input mode from the first argument:
- If it starts with `http://` or `https://`, treat it as a URL — fetch the page to extract the recipe content, and treat that URL as the implicit source URL (unless a second argument overrides it)
  - **YouTube watch URLs** (`youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID`): extract the video ID and set the thumbnail to `https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VIDEO_ID/hq720.jpg`, then attempt to retrieve the description using the following fallback sequence:
    1. Try WebFetch on the YouTube URL first — if it returns usable description content, use that
    2. If WebFetch fails or returns no description, fall back to Playwright: navigate to the page, wait 3 seconds for it to load, then click the "...more" button to expand the full description
    3. Once the description is obtained (by either method), scan it for recipe content:
       - **Recipe in description**: if the description contains ingredients or instructions directly, use that as the recipe content
       - **Link in description**: if the description contains a link to an external recipe page (e.g. a blog post or dedicated recipe URL), fetch that URL using WebFetch and extract the recipe from there instead; record both the YouTube URL and the recipe page URL — both will appear in the output file
       - **Inline text fallback**: if neither is found in the description, fall back to any inline text provided in the arguments
    4. Use the channel name and video title to identify the creator
- Otherwise, treat it as a local file path — read the file

**Creator identification from channel URL:**
- If any argument is a YouTube channel URL (e.g., `youtube.com/@Handle` or `youtube.com/c/name`), try to fetch that page to extract the creator's real name
- If the fetch fails, derive the name from the handle by splitting on capitalisation (e.g., `@FastEasyRecipes` → `Fast Easy Recipes`)
- Use that name in the `creator` frontmatter field

Apply the formatting rules below to the recipe content.

**Frontmatter:**
- Generate YAML frontmatter at the top of the file (before the source URL line) with these fields:
  ```
  ---
  creator: '[[Author Name]]'
  pic: <hero-image-url>
  tags:
  - recipe
  - <creator tag>
  ---
  ```
- The creator tag is the resolved page name lowercased with all spaces and separators removed (e.g., `Andrea Geary` → `andreagreary`, `budgetbytes` → `budgetbytes`, `Fast Easy Recipes` → `fasteasyrecipes`)
- Extract the author/creator name from the recipe page (e.g., from the recipe card's author field or the blog's about page)
- Resolve the creator's page name using this priority order:
  1. If the recipe comes from the author's own personal domain, use the domain name without TLD as the page name (e.g., `budgetbytes.com` → `budgetbytes`, `halfbakedharvest.com` → `halfbakedharvest`). This is their chosen vanity identity.
  2. If the recipe comes from a major publication (e.g., Bon Appétit, Serious Eats, NYT Cooking, Food Network, Epicurious, Tasty), use the author's name as credited on that publication — the content belongs to the publication, not the individual's personal brand.
  3. If there is no personal domain (e.g., YouTube-only creators), use the author's real name.
- Use the resolved page name in the `creator` frontmatter wikilink (e.g., `[[budgetbytes]]`)
- After writing the file, check whether a page named `<page name>.md` exists in the same directory as the recipe file — if it does not exist, create a minimal stub: a file containing `# <page name>` followed by a blank line and the author's source URL (e.g. their YouTube channel URL, website, or wherever the recipe came from)

## Formatting rules

**Ingredients:**
- Format every ingredient line as a checked checkbox: `- [x] quantity [[ingredient name]]`
- Wrap the ingredient name (not the quantity or descriptors) in Obsidian wikilinks: `[[ingredient name]]`
- Ensure the wikilink covers the entire product name to link to the corresponding product page in the repository
  - Example: `1 cup julienned carrots` → `- [x] 1 cup julienned [[carrots]]`
  - Example: `2 teaspoons sesame oil` → `- [x] 2 teaspoons [[sesame oil]]` (not `sesame [[oil]]`)
- If the ingredient already has a wikilink, leave it as-is

**Instructions:**
- Never capitalize the first letter of an instruction line (lowercase start)
- Do not end any instruction with a period
- Each sentence is its own paragraph — split multi-sentence instructions into individual sentences, each separated by a blank line
- Remove any bold, italics, or emphasis formatting — plain text only
- Always use plain paragraphs for instructions — if the original uses a numbered/ordered list, convert each item to a plain paragraph
- If a step lists multiple items in a comma-separated sequence (e.g., "add onions, oil, butter, and salt"), expand that list into a Markdown bullet sub-list, keeping the surrounding sentence intact:

  Example input:
  ```
  add onions, oil, remaining butter, salt and pepper to pan
  ```
  Example output:
  ```
  add

  - onions
  - oil
  - remaining butter
  - salt
  - pepper

  to pan
  ```

**Mise en place (Prep section):**
- Extract any prep-type steps from the instructions and place them in a `## Prep` section immediately above `## Instructions`
- Prep steps are tasks that can be done ahead of time before cooking begins: chopping, dicing, mincing, measuring, soaking, washing, resting dough, etc.
- Format each prep step as a plain paragraph (no leading bullet), separated by blank lines — same structure as instructions
- If a prep step involves multiple constituent items, keep the action as a plain paragraph and list the items as a bullet sub-list beneath it (same comma-expansion rule as instructions)
- Apply the same instruction formatting rules: lowercase start, no trailing period
- Remove the extracted steps from the Instructions section — do not duplicate them
- If a `## Prep` section already exists, merge any newly extracted steps into it

**Dish image:**
- Find the main hero image for the recipe (e.g., from og:image meta tag or the primary recipe photo)
- Place it as an inline markdown image immediately after the frontmatter block, before the source URL: `![dish name](image-url)`
- If an image is already present at that position, leave it as-is

**Nutrition section:**
- Remove the Nutrition section entirely if present

**YouTube links:**
- Convert any long YouTube URLs to short format: `https://youtu.be/VIDEO_ID`
  - Example: `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abc123` → `https://youtu.be/abc123`
  - Example: `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abc123&t=45s` → `https://youtu.be/abc123?t=45`
- Keep existing short `youtu.be` URLs as-is
- If a YouTube video ID is present and the file has a `pic` frontmatter field, verify the thumbnail URL before using it: run `curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" URL` on `hq720.jpg` first — if it returns 200 use it; if it returns 404 fall back to `hqdefault.jpg`

**Timestamps:**
- If an instruction references a video timestamp in `[MM:SS]` format with an associated YouTube URL, convert it to an absolute markdown link using the `?t=` parameter in seconds
  - Example: `[00:17]` with video `https://youtu.be/Wnt90dkEwFs` → `[00:17](https://youtu.be/Wnt90dkEwFs?t=17)`
  - Example: `[01:05]` → `?t=65`
- The link text should be the timestamp in `[MM:SS]` format
- If no YouTube URL is available for a timestamp, leave it as plain text

## Example output

```
crack the eggs into a bowl, see [00:05](https://youtu.be/Wnt90dkEwFs?t=5)

whisk until fully combined

pour into a heated, greased pan, see [00:17](https://youtu.be/Wnt90dkEwFs?t=17)

cook until edges begin to set
```

## Steps

1. Determine input mode from the first argument (URL vs file path)
2. Fetch or read the recipe content accordingly; extract the author name and hero image URL
3. Apply all formatting rules to the recipe content — convert instruction ordered lists to plain paragraphs; apply instruction-specific rules (lowercase, no trailing period, sentence splitting) only to instruction lines
4. Place YAML frontmatter at the very top of the file with `creator`, `pic`, and `tags`
5. Place the hero image immediately after the frontmatter block, then the source URL(s) on the next line(s), followed by a blank line — if a source URL already exists, replace it; if the recipe was fetched from an external page linked in a YouTube description, place the YouTube URL first and the recipe page URL on the line below it
6. Do not include a `# Title` heading — the filename serves as the page title in Obsidian
7. For file mode: overwrite the file with the cleaned content and confirm success — do not output the full recipe content to the chat
8. For URL mode: display the formatted recipe in the chat, then immediately write it to a file without asking — derive the filename from the recipe title using spaces (not hyphens) with a `.md` extension; when the creator is known, prefix the filename with the creator name to avoid collisions between recipes with the same dish name (e.g., `Fast Easy Recipes crepes.md`); save to the same directory as other recipe files in the vault
9. After writing the file, check whether the creator's page exists in the same directory — if not, create a stub page named `<page name>.md` containing just `# <page name>` (using the resolved page name from the frontmatter rules above)
